**animate-images** is a lightweight (9.5kb without gzip) library that animates a sequence of images 
to use in animations or pseudo 3d product view. It works WITHOUT UI and mainly 
developed for complex animations.

To use it you have to get a series of frames from a video or 3d app. 
The frames must be separate images of the same size.

### Browser script tag
Add with CDN link:
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@its2easy/animate-images"></script>
```
Or download <a href="https://unpkg.com/@its2easy/animate-images">minified version</a>
 and include in html:
```html
<script src="animate-images.min.js"></script>
```
```javascript
let instance = animateImages.init(element, options)
```
### npm
```
npm i @its2easy/animate-images --save
```
```javascript
import { init as animateImages } from '@its2easy/animate-images';
let instance = animateImages(element, options);
```
It is possible to import untranspiled esm version:
```javascript
import { init as animateImages } from '@its2easy/build/animate-images.esm.js'; //or animate-images.esm.min.js
```
> :warning: You should probably add it to your build process if you use esm version. Example for webpack:
```javascript
rules: [
    {
        test: /\.js$/,
        exclude: /node_modules(?!(\/|\\)@its2easy(\/|\\)animate-images)/,
        use: {
            loader: 'babel-loader',
        }
    }
]
```
or
```javascript
rules: [
    {
        // basic js rule
        test: /\.js$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: {
            loader: 'babel-loader',
        }
    },
    {
        // additional rule
        test: /\.js$/,
        include: /node_modules(\/|\\)@its2easy(\/|\\)animate-images/,
        use: {
            loader: 'babel-loader',
        }
    },
]
```

## <a name="usage"></a>Usage
Create canvas element 
```html
 <canvas class="canvas_el" width="800" height="500"></canvas>
```

Initialize with options
```javascript
let element = document.querySelector('.canvas_el');
let imagesArray = Array.from(new Array(90), (v, k) => { // generate array of urls
    let number = String(k).padStart(4, "0");
    return `path/to/your/images/frame-${number}.jpg`;
});
let instance = animateImages.init(element,
    {
        images: imagesArray, /* required */
        preload: "partial",
        preloadNumber: 20,
        loop: true,
        fps: 60,
        poster: 'path/to/poster/image.jpg',
    }
);
instance.play();
```

Methods called from `onPreloadFinished` callback will start immediately, but you have to use `options.preload: 'all'`
or call `plugin.preload()`. The plugin loads each image only once, so it's safe to call `preload` multiple times, 
even after the load has been completed. If `autoplay: true`, full preload will start immediately.
```javascript
let instance = animateImages.init(element,
    {
        images: imagesArray,
        preload: "none", // if 'all', you don't need to call preload()
        onPreloadFinished: function (lib){
            lib.play();
        }
    }
);
instance.preload(30);//load the first part

setTimeout(() => {
 instance.preload(60);// laod the rest
}, 1000);
// or instance.preload() to load all the images
```
Methods that were called from outside of `onPreloadFinished` will trigger the load of all unloaded images, 
wait for the full load, and then execute the action. if multiple methods have been called before 
load, only the last will be executed
```javascript
let instance = animateImages.init(element,
    {
        images: imagesArray,
        preload: "none", 
    }
);
// if preload: "none", it will trigger the load, and play after each image loaded
// if preload: "all", it will wait until full load and then start
instance.play(); 
```
In general, the plugin will load all the frames before any action, but you can preload a part of the 
images in some cases, for example when user is scrolling to the section in which the animation will 
take place.

### Sizes and responsive behavior
Width of the canvas is defined by page CSS. To calculate height, plugin uses ratio from
inline width and height canvas properties `<canvas width="1600" height="900">` (if they're not set, default
 are 300x150). This ratio can be overwritten by `options.ratio`. Height of the canvas should be `'auto'` and 
not fixed by CSS. If the height is fixed, the ratio can't be used, and the canvas will use its natural CSS 
size. The dimensions of the images are taken from the image itself after load, and they do not need to be 
set anywhere in the settings.

If the canvas and images have the same ratio, full image will be displayed. If the ratios are the same, 
but sizes are different, image will be scaled to fit the canvas. On the page the canvas with the image will
be scaled to canvas CSS size.

If canvas and image ratios are different, then image will use `options.fillMode`, which works like 
background-size `cover` and `contain`. Image will be centered.

So to display the full image, check the image width and height, and set it as canvas inline `width` and `height` 
(or set `options.ratio`).
Then set canvas width by CSS (width="500px" or width="100%" or max-width="800px" etc), and don't set 
canvas height. 

For example, &lt;canvas width="800" height="400"&gt;, image 1200x600, canvas has css max-width="500px". 
Image will be scaled to 800x400 inside canvas and fully visible, canvas on the page will be displayed 
500px x 250px.

After page resize, the sizes will be recalculated automatically, but if canvas was resized by script, call 
`instance.updateCanvas()`

## <a name="options"></a>Options

```javascript
animateImages(element, options);

## <a name="events"></a>Events
Plugin fires all the events on the canvas element.

**animate-images:loading-progress** - 
Fires after every image load. Progress amount is in `event.detail.progress`

**animate-images:loading-error** - 
Fires after every image.onerror

**animate-images:preload-finished** -
Fires when all the images have been loaded, and the plugin is ready to play

**animate-images:poster-loaded** -
Fires when poster has been loaded

**animate-images:animation-end** -
Fires after the animation end. If the second animation was started 
while the first was active, this event will be fired only after the 
second animation end.

Example:
```javascript
let element = document.querySelector('.canvas_el');
let instance = animateImages.init(element, options);
element.addEventListener('animate-images:loading-progress', function (e){
    console.log(Math.floor(e.detail.progress * 100) + '%');
});
```
